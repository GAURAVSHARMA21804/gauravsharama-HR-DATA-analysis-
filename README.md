Whole-sale-DATA-analysis working on machine learning model of clustering

Outcomes:-
In this project  the whole analysis of Wholesale Customers data we find out the they have a small realation between the all feature vectors and when we applied
the K-mean and Agglomerative clustering only 2 clusters are made because the differnces between the centroid of dataset is very small and we made 3 clusters they overlap each other.
